# https://hlandau.github.io/acme/userguide#response-files
#
# This is a example of a response file, used with --response-file.
# It automatically answers prompts for unattended operation.
# grep for UniqueID in the source code for prompt names.
# Pass --response-file to all invocations, not just quickstart.
# If you don't pass --response-file, it will be looked for at "(state-dir)/conf/responses".
# You will typically want to use --response-file with --stdio or --batch.
# For dialogs not requiring a response, but merely acknowledgement, specify true.
# This file is YAML. Note that JSON is a subset of YAML.
